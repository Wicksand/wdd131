        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>As a self-taught hobby baker, I love to find and experiment with recipes. My family and I have enjoyed baking and cooking together since I was small, and I have learned so much from all of them. I will always remember those joy-filled afternoons sitting on the kitchen counter to peek into my motherâ€™s stand mixer, or the happy evenings rolling cookie dough balls with my father. I was often asked how I made specific recipes or what was in the treats I made. This website is my attempt to effectively answer these questions, and have a little fun baking too. I hope you find as much joy and showstopper potential in these recipes as I have.</p>
